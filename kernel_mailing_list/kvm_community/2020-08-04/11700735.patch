Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] KVM: arm64: pvtime: Fixes and a new cap
Date: Tue,  4 Aug 2020 19:05:58 +0200
Message-Id: <20200804170604.42662-1-drjones@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.79 on 10.5.11.11
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org

v2:
  - ARM_SMCCC_HV_PV_TIME_FEATURES now also returns SMCCC_RET_NOT_SUPPORTED
    when steal time is not supported
  - Added READ_ONCE() for the run_delay read
  - Reworked kvm_put/get_guest to not require type as a parameter
  - Added some more text to the documentation for KVM_CAP_STEAL_TIME
  - Enough changed that I didn't pick up Steven's r-b's


The first four patches in the series are fixes that come from testing
and reviewing pvtime code while writing the QEMU support[*]. The last
patch is only a convenience for userspace, and I wouldn't be heartbroken
if it wasn't deemed worth it. The QEMU patches are currently written
without the cap. However, if the cap is accepted, then I'll change the
QEMU code to use it.

Thanks,
drew
