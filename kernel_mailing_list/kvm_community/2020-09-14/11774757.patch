Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: VMX: Clean up IRQ/NMI handling
Date: Mon, 14 Sep 2020 12:56:32 -0700

Minor (if there is such a thing for this code) cleanup of KVM's handling
of IRQ and NMI exits to move the invocation of the IRQ handler to a
standalone assembly routine, and to then consolidate the NMI handling to
use the same indirect call approach instead of using INTn.

The IRQ cleanup was suggested by Josh Poimboeuf in the context of a false
postive objtool warning[*].  I believe Josh intended to use UNWIND hints
instead of trickery to avoid objtool complaints.  I opted for trickery in
the form of a redundant, but explicit, restoration of RSP after the hidden
IRET.  AFAICT, there are no existing UNWIND hints that would let objtool
know that the stack is magically being restored, and adding a new hint to
save a single MOV <reg>, <reg> instruction seemed like overkill.

The NMI consolidation was loosely suggested by Andi Kleen.  Andi's actual
suggestion was to export and directly call the NMI handler, but that's a
more involved change (unless I'm misunderstanding the wants of the NMI
handler), whereas piggybacking the IRQ code is simple and seems like a
worthwhile intermediate step.
