Subject: [PATCH RFC 0/2] KVM: x86: allow for more CPUID entries
Date: Tue, 15 Sep 2020 17:43:04 +0200
Message-Id: <20200915154306.724953-1-vkuznets@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0

With QEMU and newer AMD CPUs (namely: Epyc 'Rome') the current limit for
KVM_MAX_CPUID_ENTRIES(80) is reported to be hit. Last time it was raised
from '40' in 2010. We can, of course, just bump it a little bit to fix
the immediate issue but the report made me wonder why we need to pre-
allocate vcpu->arch.cpuid_entries array instead of sizing it dynamically.
This RFC is intended to feed my curiosity.

Very mildly tested with selftests/kvm-unit-tests and nothing seems to
break. I also don't have access to the system where the original issue
was reported but chances we're fixing it are very good IMO as just the
second patch alone was reported to be sufficient.
