Subject: [PATCH] KVM: nVMX: Consult only the "basic" exit reason when routing
 nested exit
Date: Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:44:30 -0800
Message-Id: <20200227174430.26371-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.24.1
MIME-Version: 1.0

X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org

Consult only the basic exit reason, i.e. bits 15:0 of vmcs.EXIT_REASON,
when determining whether a nested VM-Exit should be reflected into L1 or
handled by KVM in L0.

For better or worse, the switch statement in nested_vmx_exit_reflected()
currently defaults to "true", i.e. reflects any nested VM-Exit without
dedicated logic.  Because the case statements only contain the basic
exit reason, any VM-Exit with modifier bits set will be reflected to L1,
even if KVM intended to handle it in L0.

Practically speaking, this only affects EXIT_REASON_MCE_DURING_VMENTRY,
i.e. a #MC that occurs on nested VM-Enter would be incorrectly routed to
L1, as "failed VM-Entry" is the only modifier that KVM can currently
encounter.  The SMM modifiers will never be generated as KVM doesn't
support/employ a SMI Transfer Monitor.  Ditto for "exit from enclave",
as KVM doesn't yet support virtualizing SGX, i.e. it's impossible to
enter an enclave in a KVM guest (L1 or L2).

Fixes: 644d711aa0e1 ("KVM: nVMX: Deciding if L0 or L1 should handle an L2 exit")
