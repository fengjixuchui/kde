Hi Drew,

There's some minor cleanups which based on your arm/queue branch for
the timer test.  Please consider taking them if they make the code
a bit better :)

Thanks

Zenghui Yu (3):
  arm/arm64: gic: Move gic_state enumeration to asm/gic.h
  arm64: timer: Use the proper RDist register name in GICv3
  arm64: timer: Use existing helpers to access counter/timers
