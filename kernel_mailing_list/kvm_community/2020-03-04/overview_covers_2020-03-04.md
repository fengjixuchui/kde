KVM branch:
  https://github.com/xzpeter/linux/tree/kvm-dirty-ring

QEMU branch for testing:
  https://github.com/xzpeter/qemu/tree/kvm-dirty-ring

v5:
- rebased to 5.6-rc4 (removed Paolo's r-b in patch 4 for context change)
- selftest: run all supported modes if mode not specified [Drew]
- selftest: expose vcpu->fd directly to test using vcpu_get_fd [Drew]

v4:
- refactor ring layout: remove indices, use bit 0/1 in the gfn.flags
  field to encode GFN status (invalid, dirtied, collected) [Michael,
  Paolo]
- patch memslot_valid_for_gpte() too to check against memslot flags
  rather than dirty_bitmap pointer
- fix build on non-x86 arch [syzbot]
- fix comment for kvm_dirty_gfn [Michael]
- check against VM_EXEC, VM_SHARED for mmaps [Michael]
- fix "KVM: X86: Don't track dirty for
  KVM_SET_[TSS_ADDR|IDENTITY_MAP_ADDR]" to unbreak
  unrestricted_guest=N [Sean]
- some rework in the test code, e.g., more comments

Overview
============

This is a continued work from Lei Cao <lei.cao@stratus.com> and Paolo
Bonzini on the KVM dirty ring interface.

The new dirty ring interface is another way to collect dirty pages for
the virtual machines. It is different from the existing dirty logging
interface in a few ways, majorly:

  - Data format: The dirty data was in a ring format rather than a
    bitmap format, so dirty bits to sync for dirty logging does not
    depend on the size of guest memory any more, but speed of
    dirtying.  Also, the dirty ring is per-vcpu, while the dirty
    bitmap is per-vm.

  - Data copy: The sync of dirty pages does not need data copy any more,
    but instead the ring is shared between the userspace and kernel by
    page sharings (mmap() on vcpu fd)

  - Interface: Instead of using the old KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG,
    KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG interfaces, the new ring uses the new
    KVM_RESET_DIRTY_RINGS ioctl when we want to reset the collected
    dirty pages to protected mode again (works like
    KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG, but ring based).  To collecting dirty bits,
    we only need to read the ring data, no ioctl is needed.

Ring Layout
===========

KVM dirty ring is per-vcpu.  Each ring is an array of kvm_dirty_gfn
defined as:

struct kvm_dirty_gfn {
        __u32 flags;
        __u32 slot; /* as_id | slot_id */
        __u64 offset;
};

Each GFN is a state machine itself.  The state is embeded in the flags
field, as defined in the uapi header:

/*
 * KVM dirty GFN flags, defined as:
 *
 * |---------------+---------------+--------------|
 * | bit 1 (reset) | bit 0 (dirty) | Status       |
 * |---------------+---------------+--------------|
 * |             0 |             0 | Invalid GFN  |
 * |             0 |             1 | Dirty GFN    |
 * |             1 |             X | GFN to reset |
 * |---------------+---------------+--------------|
 *
 * Lifecycle of a dirty GFN goes like:
 *
 *      dirtied         collected        reset
 * 00 -----------> 01 -------------> 1X -------+
 *  ^                                          |
 *  |                                          |
 *  +------------------------------------------+
 *
 * The userspace program is only responsible for the 01->1X state
 * conversion (to collect dirty bits).  Also, it must not skip any
 * dirty bits so that dirty bits are always collected in sequence.
 */

Testing
=======

This series provided both the implementation of the KVM dirty ring and
the test case.  Also I've implemented the QEMU counterpart that can
run with the new KVM, link can be found at the top of the cover
letter.  However that's still a very initial version which is prone to
change and future optimizations.

I did some measurement with the new method with 24G guest running some
dirty workload, I don't see any speedup so far, even in some heavy
dirty load it'll be slower (e.g., when 800MB/s random dirty rate, kvm
dirty ring takes average of ~73s to complete migration while dirty
logging only needs average of ~55s).  However that's understandable
because 24G guest means only 1M dirty bitmap, that's still a suitable
case for dirty logging.  Meanwhile heavier workload means worst case
for dirty ring.

More tests are welcomed if there's bigger host/guest, especially on
COLO-like workload.

Please review, thanks.

This (now shorter) series expands the existing GICv4 support to deal
with the new GICv4.1 architecture, which comes with a set of major
improvements compared to v4.0:

- One architectural doorbell per vcpu, instead of one doorbell per VLPI

- Doorbell entirely managed by the HW, with an "at most once" delivery
  guarantee per non-residency phase and only when requested by the
  hypervisor

- A shared memory scheme between ITSs and redistributors, allowing for an
  optimised residency sequence (the use of VMOVP becomes less frequent)

- Support for direct virtual SGI delivery (the injection path still involves
  the hypervisor), at the cost of losing the active state on SGIs. It
  shouldn't be a big deal, but some guest operating systems might notice
  (Linux definitely won't care).

On the other hand, public documentation is not available yet, so that's a
bit annoying...

The series is roughly organised in 3 parts:

(0) Fixes
(1) v4.1 doorbell management
(2) Virtual SGI support
(3) Plumbing of virtual SGIs in KVM

Notes:

  - The whole thing is tested on a FVP model, which can be obtained
    free of charge on ARM's developer website. It requires you to
    create an account, unfortunately... You'll need a fix for the
    devicetree that is in the kernel tree (should be merged before
    the 5.6 release).

  - This series has uncovered a behaviour that looks like a HW bug on
    the Cavium ThunderX (aka TX1) platform. I'd very much welcome some
    clarification from the Marvell/Cavium folks on Cc, as well as an
    official erratum number if this happens to be an actual bug.

    [v3 update]
    People have ignored for two months now, and it is fairly obvious
    that support for this machine is slowly bit-rotting. Maybe I'll
    drop the patch and instead start the process of removing all TX1
    support from the kernel (we'd certainly be better off without it).

    [v4 update]
    TX1 is now broken in mainline, and nobody cares. Make of this what
    you want.

  - I'm extremely grateful for Zenghui Yu's huge effort in carefully
    reviewing this rather difficult series (if we ever get to meet
    face to face, drinks are definitely on me!).

  - Unless someone cries wolf, I plan to take this into 5.7.

* From v4 [4]
  - Rebased on v5.6-rc4
  - Fixed locking all over the shop now that we can bypass the ITS
  - Wait on INVALL at the RD level
  - Plentu of cleanups/fixes thanks to Zenghui's careful review effort

* From v3 [3]:
  - Rebased on v5.6-rc1
  - Considerably smaller thanks to the initial patches being merged
  - Small bug fix after the v5.6 merge window

* From v2 [2]:
  - Another bunch of fixes thanks to Zenghui Yu's very careful review
  - HW-accelerated SGIs are now optional thanks to new architected
    discovery/selection bits exposed by KVM and used by the guest kernel
  - Rebased on v5.5-rc2

* From v1 [1]:
  - A bunch of minor reworks after Zenghui Yu's review
  - A workaround for what looks like a new and unexpected TX1 bug
  - A subtle reorder of the series so that some patches can go in early
