What started this series is Andre's SPI and group interrupts tests [1],
which prompted me to attempt to rewrite check_acked() so it's more flexible
and not so complicated to review. When I was doing that I noticed that the
message passing pattern for accesses to the acked, bad_irq and bad_sender
arrays didn't look quite right, and that turned into the first 7 patches of
the series. Even though the diffs are relatively small, they are not
trivial and the reviewer can skip them for the more palatable patches that
follow. I would still appreciate someone having a look at the memory
ordering fixes.

Patch #8 ("Split check_acked() into two functions") is where check_acked()
is reworked with an eye towards supporting different timeout values or
silent reporting without adding too many arguments to check_acked().

After changing the IPI tests, I turned my attention to the LPI tests, which
followed the same memory synchronization patterns, but invented their own
interrupt handler and testing functions. Instead of redoing the work that I
did for the IPI tests, I decided to convert the LPI tests to use the same
infrastructure. It turns out that was a good idea, because it uncovered a
test inconsistency that was hidden before. I am not familiar with the ITS
and I'm not sure that there is even a problem or if the behaviour is
expected, details in the last patch.
