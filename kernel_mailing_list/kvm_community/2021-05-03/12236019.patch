Subject: [PATCH 0/5] KVM: nSVM: few fixes for the nested migration
Date: Mon,  3 May 2021 15:54:41 +0300

MIME-Version: 1.0

Those are few fixes for issues I uncovered by doing variants of a
synthetic migration test I just created:

I modified the qemu, such that on each vm pause/resume cycle,
just prior to resuming a vCPU, qemu reads its KVM state,
then (optionaly) resets this state by uploading a
dummy reset state to KVM, and then it uploads back to KVM,
the state that this vCPU had before.

I'll try to make this test upstreamable soon, pending few details
I need to figure out.

Last patch in this series is for false positive warning
that I have seen lately when setting the nested state,
in nested_svm_vmexit, where it expects the vmcb01 to have
VMRUN vmexit, which is not true after nested migration,
as it is not fully initialized.
If you prefer the warning can be removed instead.

Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
