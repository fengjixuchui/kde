Subject: [PATCH] vfio-ccw: document possible errors
Date: Tue,  7 Apr 2020 13:16:05 +0200
Message-Id: <20200407111605.1795-1-cohuck@redhat.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
X-Scanned-By: MIMEDefang 2.79 on 10.5.11.12
Sender: kvm-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org

Interacting with the I/O and the async regions can yield a number
of errors, which had been undocumented so far. These are part of
the api, so remedy that.
